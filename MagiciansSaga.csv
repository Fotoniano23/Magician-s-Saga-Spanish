"#00367","Greetings. I am the king of this<br>recently depopulated land. Actually,<br>this is my first day on the job."
,"The first thing I noticed was<br>the inexplicable disappearance<br>of our most precious orb."
,"My first act was to call for the great<br>magician who served the last king.<br>I hope he can explain the details."
"#00368","Heh heh heh! I am the court<br>magician! I am famous for having<br>once retrieved the lost orb."
,"Now it is your task to find the orb<br>and restore prosperity to the land."
,"Start by going left. Your first quest<br>will take you to the <co=4a86e8>grassy plain</co>."
"#00369","Heh heh heh! So I've heard you<br>discovered a new destination."
,"Well, what are you waiting for? Go!"
"#00370","You have retrieved the orb! <br>Well done!<br>Now I can rest assured that my land<br>shall enjoy peace and prosperity."
,"Most impressive work, mage!"
"#00371","Proceed with care, as vile foes<br>are sure to obstruct your way!"
,"Tap the arrow icon on the bottom<br>left of the screen to move forward."
"#00372","An enemy appeared!<br>In order to attack, you will first need to <co=4a86e8>stop walking</co>."
,"So, if you see an enemy, stop!<br>Remember it well."
"#00373","I'm sensing something... It's the<br>presence of a boss monster!"
,"By the way, if your HP or MP is low,<br>try walking. There is a chance<br>they will both recover a little."
,"Time to defeat the boss monster!"
"#00374","Heh heh heh! Excellent spellwork!"
,"Keep going and you shall<br>come upon a treasure chest!"
"#00375","Heh heh heh!<br>This is the last stage of this area.<br>Don't let your guard down!"
"#00376","Thank you, kind stranger, for saving me from the clutches of those monsters!"
,"I'm not the only one who was captured. Please rescue the others as well!"
,"Now that I'm safe...<br>I'll go back to my quiet life in the town."
"#00377","I've heard of your adventures. Well done!"
,"With more townsfolk brought back,<br>we now have<co=4a86e8> more space to build on</co>."
"#00378","Terrific work, well done!<br>The town's expanding wonderfully."
,"Rescue a few more people and this town will look like the bustling capital of old!"
"#00379","I am pleased to see you. Here is<br>a little something from me as a<br>reward for your amazing score."
,"A score above <1> is truly excellent.<br>Here, take these <co=4a86e8><0> Crystals</co> as a <br>little token of my appreciation!"
"#00380","And now..."
,"Since your score is so impressively high, I have unlocked landscape mode for you."
"#00381","You have all this Stamina and yet you are not questing? Go on an adventure!"
"#00382","My, my!<br>You are out of Stamina.<br>This simply will not do."
,"There is a legend about a mystical<br>Stamina-replenishing drink. But where could we find such a precious elixir?"
,"Rustle, rustle..."
,"Ah, I had one in my pocket!<br>Here, drink it, and you will recover Stamina immediately."
,"What are you waiting for?<br>The color seems a bit off, but I am<br>sure it has not expired just yet."
"#00383","Excellent, so you have returned<br>in one piece, and you have leveled<br>up as well? Well done!"
,"Complete quests to level up.<br>You'll get stronger, and be able<br>to face off ever tougher foes."
"#00384","You're really getting the knack of this<br>adventuring thing, aren't you?"
,"I can tell you have what it takes to<br>become an accomplished magician."
"#00385","Questing is now your bread and butter, is it not, young mage?"
,"I tip my hat to you. Good to see my<br>successor keeping up the good work."
"#00386","The town wardens carried you back<br>after you fell in battle."
,"You appear to be unhurt.<br>When the going gets tough, don't hesitate to ask for advice."
"#00387","Oh, defeated again? Don't worry,<br>it is nothing to be ashamed of."
,"Enhance your powers at the MagiMart, or train on earlier stages to level up and get some money, then try again."
,"I had something for you in case<br>this happened... Here, take this."
"#00388","What an auspicious day!<br>I have just opened my very own<br>branch of the MagiMart."
,"Is your magic too weak?<br>Spells not giving enough oomph?<br>Look no further, I have what you need!"
,"Please come and look at my wares."
"#00389","Hello.<br>I am the owner of Rods&Rods.<br>I sell...rods. Ahem."
,"My range of magic rods is certain<br>to spark an interest, and loosen<br>the purse strings, of any magician."
,"I hope to see you soon in my shop."
"#00390","Howdy!<br>I've opened a brand new inn,<br>the first inn in this town, in fact!"
,"An inn is where adventurers from<br>all over come to mingle. Why quest<br>alone when you can go as a team?"
,"I expect to see more customers<br>as time goes on. Bring Crystals<br>with you, and find some buddies!"
"#00391","Good day! Leave your sartorial needs to me and my newly-opened Clothier shop."
,"In the olden days, wizards would wear just one tatty robe all game long. We now know that's unhygienic!"
,"Please visit my shop. Let's turn you into the most fashionable mage out there!"
"#00392","Hello.<br>Might I interest you in my new shop,<br>the magnificent Top Hatter?"
,"Now and then I hear people talk about tipping their hat to someone when they're not even wearing a hat! Absurd!"
,"That's why I decided it was only right<br>and proper for me to open a hat shop and provide the people with hats."
"#00393","The lodge construction is complete."
,"Your team mates can now move in.<br>They will fight by your side when<br>you go off on one of your quests."
,"Go to the inn to find adventurers<br>who may want to join you."
"#00394","Hi there.<br>I'm the owner of Upgrader."
,"I sell the keys that unlock new<br>and amazing features for the<br>other shops in town!"
,"What's the point of upgrading shops?<br>Well, they will have new items to sell!"
,"So, if other shops don't have<br>what you need, maybe it's<br>time for an upgrade!"
"#00395","My word! I am impressed by the way<br>you dealt with that annoying rock!<br>Bravo!"
,"I trust you will continue to do your<br>utmost to help us develop the land<br>and expand the city."
"#00396","Oh, someone's decided to join your party!"
,"In my day, I had to battle monsters all by myself.<br>My, how times are changing."
,"I am not sure if you are aware,<br>but allies will only fight with you<br>if they have a lodge to stay in."
,"See about building one soon."
"#00397","I recently had my photograph<br>taken by a famous photographer.<br>Perhaps you would like a copy?"
,"You could display it in your living room. Of course, I can't just give it away.<br>It will be 500,0000G."
,"Is something wrong?"
,"You...can't afford it?<br>But surely you must have enough.<br>I could find at least a few million if<br>I looked down the back of my sofa..."
,"Well, now I feel bad.<br>Why don't you take my leftover<br>pocket money for this month?<br>There you go."
"#00398","You seem to have a bit of cash<br>saved up these days."
,"How about spending it in the MagiMart or using it to remove those pesky rocks?"
,"In other words, use money to either<br>better yourself...or the town."
"#00399","I got the most curious gift the other day from a traveling merchant."
,"It's a wooden figurine which bears<br>striking resemblance to me!"
,"I can give it to you, if you like.<br>In exchange for 250,000 Crystals.<br>That's a steal, I say!<br>Do you want it?"
,"You what?<br>You don't have enough Crystals?<br>Not even 250,000?!<br>How...puzzling."
,"Oh, well.<br>I guess I could let you have the ones<br>I was going to give to my pet. You can<br>probably make better use of them."
"#00400","I'm pleased to see you finally have<br>a decent amount of Crystals."
,"They're very rare, but can be used<br>to buy all sorts of things."
,"I'm not sure if it's true, but I heard that if you touch this Kairobot person that sometimes visits the town, it might give you Crystals."
,"It can't hurt to give it a try."
"#00401","(Need to use the Upgrader to unlock this.)"
"#00402","The townsfolk have only good things<br>to say about you after all the good<br>work you have done for the town."
,"They erected a fountain on the plaza<br>as homage to you."
,"Once my life-long goal of world peace is achieved, they will build a giant statue of me too..."
,"So please get back to work.<br>I shall reward you handsomely."
"#00403","You have a new ally.<br>Make sure you have enough lodges."
"#00404","You have quite a few allies."
,"But remember, you can only have<br>up to 9 with you in battle. Choose<br>well who to put in a lodge."
"#00405","Hmph. I have just finished reading<br>Kingdom Building for Dummies."
,"It says there that the fountain has<br>a most remarkable effect. It lets<br>you take a photo of the land."
,"And share it via Twitter or<br>Facebook, in return for<br>1,000 Crystals and 8,000G!"
,"It is a one-time offer, so we should<br>choose wisely when to use it."
,"But on the other hand, I simply<br>cannot wait to try it out!"
"#00406","Excellent, it seems we have<br>successfully managed to share<br>a photo of our kingdom to the world."
,"This came out of the fountain when<br>we did that. It's all yours."
"#00407","Oh, wait a minute."
,"I have just noticed that all the pesky<br>rocks are gone... Thanks to you, my<br>kingdom is back to its original size!"
,"Thank you!<br>I am very grateful. You deserve<br>the title of a true hero!"
"#00408","It seems you have gained some allies.<br>Maybe it is time to edit your team?"
"#00409","You can reorganize at any time<br>by selecting their lodge."

"#00721","Hello! Take me on one of your adventures."
"#00722","I've made some sandwiches in case we get hungry."
"#00723","I may look weak, but appearances can be deceiving!"
"#00724","So, what's the quest? I'm ready for anything!"
"#00725","Hey, how about we roast some meat over the campfire?"
"#00726","Don't let your guard down, or the monsters'll get you!"
"#00727","BBQ sauce or ketchup? That is the question!"
"#00728","It's adventure time!"
"#00729","Bring it, you fiends! I'll make short work of you!"
"#00730","I like to keep my weapon looking good as new."
"#00731","Blood? Mud? Yuk. Can't stand dirt on my clothes."
"#00732","To a true warrior, anything can be a weapon. Even chicken skewers!"
"#00733","They will write hundreds of sagas of my heroic deeds!"
"#00734","They say variety is the spice of life. I think it's chili!"
"#00735","I never miss a target, and I always aim for the knee."
"#00736","Any prey I lay my eyes on is as good as dead."
"#00737","What provisions shall we take? How about cake?"
"#00738","I really like this headband."
"#00739","I really need to trim my nails."
"#00740","My bow is my closest companion. I take good care of it."
"#00741","Tsk, I need to make an appointment with a beautician."
"#00742","Ah, perfect adventuring weather, wouldn't you say?"
"#00743","I may be old, but I can still beat you whipper-snappers!"
"#00744","One move is all I need to turn any foe into dog food!"
"#00745","The best thing about adventures is the treasure!"
"#00746","Ouch, ah! Something cracked in my back!"
"#00747","I have to show off...for my dear old missus!"
"#00748","Gurgh... Mah teef, mah teef fell out!"
"#00749","I'm so strong, no one has a chance against me! Mwahaha!"
"#00750","Look at me! This is how you do it! Hyaaa!"
"#00751","I can take on whatever comes our way."
"#00752","Each scar is proof of an epic battle. Cool, huh?"
"#00753","Wait...did I lock the door? I should go check..."
"#00754","I've always been the best at vaulting!"
"#00755","Uh... Did I leave the faucet running in the bathroom?"
"#00756","Clink, clank... Man, this armor makes so much noise."
"#00757","Wearing this armor is like a work out! Check me out!"
"#00758","I'm ready to deal out justice...with my sword!"
"#00759","Slaying monsters is child's play."
"#00760","Why is this armor so tight? Did it shrink in the wash?"
"#00761","It's time I took on students to pass on my knowledge."
"#00762","Nothing whets the appetite like a good battle! Nom!"
"#00763","I may be a merchant, but I know how to fight."
"#00764","Thieves should be taught a lesson they'll never forget!"
"#00765","Aaand... Fire! If only I hit my sales target as easily!"
"#00766","Oh, the sweet jingling of coins! Music to my ears!"
"#00767","Darn it, I forgot the code to my safe..."
"#00768","Welcome! Take a look at my wares!"
"#00769","Good customers get a special discount."
"#00770","Monsters? No problem, I can cook just about anything!"
"#00771","Salt, pepper... maybe some oregano as well..."
"#00772","Here we go, monster and vegetable stir-fry! Bon appetit!"
"#00773","This knife's not for fighting, it's reserved for cooking."
"#00774","I hate it when my head gets all sweaty under my hat."
"#00775","Sniff... That smell... I can use this herb for cooking!"
"#00776","Peeling potatoes is more difficult than it looks."
"#00777","Here's a gift from me... A bullet to the head! Mwahaha!"
"#00778","Old? Who are you calling old!?"
"#00779","There's no quest I couldn't handle!"
"#00780","The treasure's all mine! Well, maybe you can have some..."
"#00781","What's sweeter than love? Candy. And Chocolate."
"#00782","What will I do when I'm rich? Keep saving money to get even richer!"
"#00783","I hate cute stuff like stuffed toys! Except for my Teddy."
"#00784","Ah, the thrill of adventure! Come on, let's go!"
"#00785","Nothing can withstand my powerful hammer smash!"
"#00786","Nothing beats finding treasure and defeating monsters!"
"#00787","My flask? It's filled with an electrolyte sports drink."
"#00788","My special skill is falling asleep while standing. Zzz..."
"#00789","My dream is to become a famous blacksmith!"
"#00790","My feet are itchy..."
"#00791","Sniping is my forte. Headshots from a mile away? Easy."
"#00792","My bandana helps me concentrate."
"#00793","My hit rate is 100%. So if I hit you, it means I wanted to."
"#00794","Questing again today, are we? Fun!"
"#00795","When people shoot down my ideas... I shoot down them."
"#00796","I used to be a hunter. I know the wilds like the back of my hand."
"#00797","Each of my guns has a name. This one here is Elisabeth."
"#00798","Whewie! I've got so much to carry."
"#00799","I figured I gotta get tough so I can fend off the bandits."
"#00800","I put my adventuring supplies down as a business expense!"
"#00801","I'm always going from town to town, peddling my wares."
"#00802","I always have a relaxing bath after a hard day's work."
"#00803","The joy I feel when reaching a new town is indescribable."
"#00804","Maybe I should buy a foot massager..."
"#00805","Hi-yah! I'll skewer any monsters in my way with my spear!"
"#00806","I love battle almost as much as I love steamed dumplings!"
"#00807","The battlefield calls to me!"
"#00808","Ready the wok! Let's make monster stir-fry!"
"#00809","Steamed buns are delicious, mmm!"
"#00810","Hya! I will be a kung fu master, just you wait and see!"
"#00811","You like my dress? I have 7 more just like it."
"#00812","Let me teach you a few things about exploring!"
"#00813","Don't eat mushrooms that grow by the roadside."
"#00814","Monsters need to be put in their place, away from us!"
"#00815","So, what is your current quest?"
"#00816","Aaaaaa-tchoo! Oh, it's just my pollen allergy."
"#00817","Never underestimate...anything! Gosh, that was deep."
"#00818","Oh, a cute bunny! So fluffy! Let me pet you!"
"#00819","My crimson armor reflects my burning passion for justice."
"#00820","Failure is not a word in my vocabulary."
"#00821","I live by a chivalric code. It governs my every action."
"#00822","My armor is custom-made. Cost me an arm and a leg..."
"#00823","Have no fear! No harm shall come to...the treasure."
"#00824","I would like to be remembered as a defender of justice."
"#00825","Sometimes I get embarrassed by how I stand out in a crowd."
"#00826","My heavy blows take down all sorts of foes."
"#00827","Is my armor heavy? Maybe at first, but I'm used to it now."
"#00828","My wife complains about the noise my armor makes, hehehe."
"#00829","For a seasoned warrior, even stale bread can be a weapon."
"#00830","It gets boiling hot inside this armor on sunny days."
"#00831","I'm glad to have such a tough, muscular body."
"#00832","I can do a handstand with my armor on. It's my party trick."
"#00833","Hyeh hyeh hyeh! I have the best magic, everyone says so."
"#00834","Would you like a sip of this...potion? Hyeh hyeh hyeh!"
"#00835","My robe, woven with enchantments, is never too hot or cold."
"#00836","I care not for treasure. I just want to practice my magic."
"#00837","Rejuvenation magic? No, that's not what magic is for."
"#00838","I'm working on a new spell."
"#00839","I'll shapeshift into a beautiful woman and have some fun!"
"#00840","(Smiles affably and nods in greeting.)"
"#00841","(Points to the mime outfit. Oh yeah, mimes don't speak.)"
"#00842","(Jumps excitedly, clapping hands, eager for adventure.)"
"#00843","(Dances strangely, anxious about the upcoming battle.)"
"#00844","(Munches on some strange food.)"
"#00845","(Smiles smugly, as if to say, ""behold the battle mime!"")"
"#00846","(Wakes up with a start, wiping drool off one cheek.)"
"#00847","Greetings! I'm at your service."
"#00848","If I only had a white horse, I could find a fair maiden..."
"#00849","What's the hold up? Let's get going."
"#00850","I use hammers because swords are too mainstream. Cool, eh?"
"#00851","Argh, that hurt! I stepped on a pin... I'm...I'm bleeding!"
"#00852","Who puts these treasure chests all over the place anyway?"
"#00853","My gaze can kill... You're only safe because of my visor."
"#00854","Hmph."
"#00855","(The warrior gazes silently. A silent protagonist?)"
"#00856","(The warrior seems to want to show off a fancy helmet.)"
"#00857","(The warrior silently vows to fell the demon lord.)"
"#00858","Ouch! Well, darn! I... I spoke."
"#00859","(The warrior hums a song. A battle theme, perhaps?)"
"#00860","(The warrior shifts about, impatient to go questing.)"
"#00861","Hi there! Sup?"
"#00862","Any pretty girls where we're going?"
"#00863","I really can fight! I got straight As in Knight school!"
"#00864","Quests? What are they? Anyway, take me with you!"
"#00865","I need to message my mom to let her know I'm doing okay..."
"#00866","I need a better weapon. How much is in my piggy bank..."
"#00867","Monsters aren't half as scary as my mom!"
"#00868","Awright! Let's deal with all these nasty monsters!"
"#00869","The monsters are harassing the villagers, we must help!"
"#00870","We heroes should never barge into houses uninvited."
"#00871","Sandwiches... Water... Potions... We're good to go!"
"#00872","Oh no! I got a hole in my sock!"
"#00873","We warriors are paragons of courage and honor!"
"#00874","This...this is terrible! A coffee stain on my cape!"
"#00875","Splashy splash!"
"#00876","Don't worry, I've learned how to move on land."
"#00877","Pokey stabby time! Fear my spear!"
"#00878","It gets so cold here on land. It must be the wind."
"#00879","I like salmon. We get along really well."
"#00880","If you need a swimming instructor, you know who to call!"
"#00881","I'll never forget the first time I had beef tongue."
"#00882","Before I knew it, people started calling me a legend."
"#00883","Legends need legendary hair. That's why I use Hero Hair Wax!"
"#00884","Prepare to be amazed!"
"#00885","Bring out the last boss! My sword is ready!"
"#00886","I am the true hero of this story!"
"#00887","Sigh... Being a legend doesn't pay what it used to."
"#00888","My friends call me ""Foot"", because I'm a leg end. Get it?"
"#00889","I'm in stealth mode. You can't see me, right?"
"#00890","Got assassins after you? Leave them to me."
"#00891","No one who's seen my face is left alive."
"#00892","I've had the best training. You can count on my skill."
"#00893","Karaoke-no-jutsu! I'll kill you softly with my song!"
"#00894","Ninja clothes are comfy and easy to wear."
"#00895","I hate hiding in leaves, the bugs get everywhere."
"#00896","Move aside, I'm the true hero!"
"#00897","My fists are almost glowing with power!"
"#00898","I'll bring down the hammer of justice on any villain!"
"#00899","Monsters? I'll beat them into a pulp."
"#00900","Come here, monster, gimme your best shot! Oh, it heard me..."
"#00901","My 500-ton punch pulverizes anything!"
"#00902","Come here, monster, gimme your best shot! Oh, it heard me..."
"#00903","I may look scrawny, but I've been trained for battle!"
"#00904","Foes leave me alone, thinking I'm already dead."
"#00905","Fighting bosses is back-breaking work."
"#00906","N-no! Don't tickle there, it's my funny bone!"
"#00907","Unkind people say I'm bone-idle."
"#00908","There's only one day a year when I feel like I fit in."
"#00909","I cannot lie to you...because you can see right through me! Hehehe."
"#00910","Muahaha! One day I'll rule the world."
"#00911","These monsters are weak. I shall have to train them myself."
"#00912","Quests? Is that what you do? I'll join you, it sounds fun."
"#00913","It wasn't easy becoming a demon lord, you know."
"#00914","Kitties... They're the cutest lifeforms."
"#00915","Human food is delicious! We could use one in our kitchens!"
"#00916","I'll teach the monsters in this area who's boss. Muahaha!"
"#00917","I'm a Mighty Morphin' Power Adventurer!"
"#00918","Villains and evil-doers, I have you in my sight!"
"#00919","You may make a hero cry...but you can't make them give up!"
"#00920","I aim to be a role model for kids, you know."
"#00921","We're leaving? Okay, let me just go to the bathroom first."
"#00922","I must fight on. It is my destiny."
"#00923","I always record my battles, to show the kids later."
"#00924","What quest shall we embark on today?"
"#00925","It behooves a king to be in touch with his subjects' needs."
"#00926","Oh, adventure? How thrilling!"
"#00927","When I was younger, I used to be a respected swordmaster."
"#00928","Let me join you. My wife will take care of the kingdom."
"#00929","I haven't held a sword in ages, but it'll come back to me!"
"#00930","Come and see my swordfighting trophies one day."
"#00931","Meow."
"#00932","Mrrrr.... Meow!"
"#00933","Hissssss!"
"#00934","Nya-nyaaaan!"
"#00935","We cats are able to speak your language once in our life."
"#00936","Mrrraow? Zzz..."
"#00937","Meowie?"
"#00938","Woof!"
"#00939","Yap! Yap!"
"#00940","Arooooo!"
"#00941","Grrrrr!"
"#00942","Arrrrrr roof!"
"#00943","Hello? Yes, this is doge."
"#00944","Bork! Bork! Bork! Say I'm a good boy! Come on!"
"#00945","Moo."
"#00946","Mmmm...moo."
"#00947","Of course my bags are full of grass. A cow's gotta eat."
"#00948","I may be a cow, but I'm as strong as a bull."
"#00949","Once I'm too old to go on quests, I'll open a dairy farm."
"#00950","Our horns are not just for show. Headbutt time!"
"#00951","Let's beef up this team!"
"#00952","Hello there."
"#00953","I'm an inventor. See? I've invented kale which eats itself."
"#00954","My brand new experimental weapon should be delivered soon."
"#00955","Questing is the perfect opportunity to collect data."
"#00956","I like bananas."
"#00957","I like banana smoothies too."
"#00958","Banana cake...isn't among my favorites."
"#00959","Heh heh."
"#00960","I am a robot. My strength is superior to that of any human."
"#00961","I acquired my spear skills by fruit picking on a farm."
"#00962","Long ago, I, and robots like me, explored space together."
"#00963","Sweet buns taste great...but I have no taste buds."
"#00964","I get philosophical sometimes. Am I self-aware?"
"#00965","Thinking of dessert always motivates me."
"#00966","Nyeh heh heh."
"#00967","One day Wairosoft will take control of this world..."
"#00968","I wish I had a mint. So I could mint my own money."
"#00969","I sell the best burgers. Where's the meat from? Don't ask."
"#00970","I like pizza."
"#00971","I dropped three million gold around here the other day."
"#00972","Any coins you find are mine. Bring them back to me, okay?"
"#00973","My blade lights itself on fire in the heat of battle."
"#00974","No foe can win against me. I'll crush them all!"
"#00975","Let's hurry up with this quest. Treasure awaits!"
"#00976","I'd like my own castle and servants."
"#00977","Take-out curry is perfect when you don't feel like cooking."
"#00978","Is there no magic spell to make a person fly?"
"#00979","I need to get new sunglasses. Maybe heart-shaped?"
"#00980","Oh, you are a magician? We could use someone like you."
"#00981","We are plagued by monsters. Please do something about them!"
"#00982","Be careful when setting out on a quest. Many dangers await."
"#00983","You may find helpful allies at the inn."
"#00984","Keep rescuing villagers, this place'll get bustling again."
"#00985","Stop and attack... Stop and attack..."
"#00986","The longer you use your equipment, the better it becomes."
"#00987","How are you? Nice weather we're having!"
